# dotemacs

My personal GNU/Emacs customizations

In order to use this configuration, clone the repository somewhere in
your $HOME and load `dotemacs.el` with

    (load "~/<path>/dotemacs.el")

That way, emacs customizations will be saved at the bottom of the
original `.emacs` file and will not be versioned.
