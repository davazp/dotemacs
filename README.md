# dotemacs

My personal GNU/Emacs customizations

In order to use this configuration, clone the repository somewhere in
your load path and require `dotemacs`:

    (add-to-list 'load-path "~/<path>/")
    (require 'dotemacs)

That way, emacs customizations will be saved at the bottom of the
original `.emacs` file and will not be versioned.
